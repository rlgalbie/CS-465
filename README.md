Architecture

Each of the different technologies used in this project provided a specific purpose. The express HTML is what allows us to actually render content to the users. The javascript classes were used to handle data transformations and displaying content dynamically to the screen. The technology used in the Admin SPA page was a lot more containerized then the code fro the front end website. The backend used MongoDB because it is a powerful nosql database that offers flexibility, scalability, as well as simplicity.

Functionality
JSON is different from javascript because it isn't so much like a language as it is a format of holding and transmitting key value pairs. 
When I created the trip card component I refactored code in order to improve functionality and create a reusable interface componment. Components like this are useful because you can build them once in one part of the application, and then reuse them throughout or populate them with different data without having to recode the simple pieces.

Testing
Postman was used to test the API endpoints and their functionality. I had to register a bearer token for the authentication that was added. The APi endpoints we exposed can take requests and return the data the user was looking for. Adding authentication to these type of requests allows you to limit who can successfully hit the endpoints and retrieve data.

Reflection
This course has really helped me understand how it all pulls together. In addition to giving me futher exposure to the javascript language style, I was able to practice routing and creating API Endpoints using Node. I am now better able to understand the structure of a web application and how to manage one
